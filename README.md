# dimRegr: Unlock Dimensional Regression Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/dimRegr](https://shinyappstore.com/a/dimRegr)__

dimRegr is a versatile application designed for three-dimensional analysis, offering users the ability to perform Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLS). PCR involves using principal components derived from independent variables to predict dependent variables, reducing dimensionality. PLSR combines the features of principal component analysis and regression to address multicollinearity and maximize predictive power. SPLS introduces sparsity into the model to enhance interpretability. dimRegr boasts a user-friendly interface that facilitates the achievement of various analytical tasks, including generating correlation matrices and plots, obtaining results from a model, producing factors and loadings result tables, and visualizing factors and loadings distributions in 2D and 3D. Users can also predict dependent variables, upload new data for prediction, and access basic descriptive statistics. **Original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183._**
